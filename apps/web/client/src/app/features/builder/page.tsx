        question: `What is ${APP_NAME}?`,
        answer: `${APP_NAME} is an open-source, visual editor for websites. It allows anyone to create and style their own websites without any coding knowledge.`,
    },
    {
        question: `What can I use ${APP_NAME} to do?`,
        answer: `${APP_NAME} is great for creating websites, prototypes, user interfaces, and designs. Whether you need a quick mockup or a full-fledged website, ask ${APP_NAME} to craft it for you.`,
    },
    {
        question: 'How do I get started?',
        answer: `Getting started with ${APP_NAME} is easy. Simply sign up for an account, create a new project, and follow our step-by-step guide to deploy your first application.`,
    },
    {
        question: `Is ${APP_NAME} free to use?`,
        answer: `${APP_NAME} is free for your first prompt, but you\'re limited by the number of messages you can send. Please see our Pricing page for more details.`,
    },
    {
        question: `What is the difference between ${APP_NAME} and other design tools?`,
        answer: `${APP_NAME} is a visual editor for code. It allows you to create and style your own creations with code as the source of truth. While it is best suited for creating websites, it can be used for anything visual – presentations, mockups, and more. Because ${APP_NAME} uses code as the source of truth, the types of designs you can create are unconstrained by ${APP_NAME}\'s interface.`,
    },
    {
        question: `Why is ${APP_NAME} open-source?`,
        answer: `Developers have historically been second-rate citizens in the design process. ${APP_NAME} was founded to bridge the divide between design and development, and we wanted to make developers first-class citizens alongside designers. We chose to be open-source to give developers transparency into how we are building ${APP_NAME} and how the work created through ${APP_NAME} will complement the work of developers.`,
