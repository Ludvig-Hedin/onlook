## CR-001 — `SIDEBAR_INSERT` hotkey advertised but unbound  *(auto-fixed)*

- **Area:** [canvas/hotkeys/index.tsx](apps/web/client/src/app/project/[id]/_components/canvas/hotkeys/index.tsx), [hotkey.ts](apps/web/client/src/components/hotkey.ts), [design-panel/index.tsx](apps/web/client/src/app/project/[id]/_components/left-panel/design-panel/index.tsx)
- **Type:** bug
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** `Hotkey.SIDEBAR_INSERT` (alt+a) was added and exposed as the keyboard shortcut for the new Insert tab in the left-panel tab list and tooltip, but no `useHotkeys` registration existed for it. Pressing alt+a did nothing. All siblings (`SIDEBAR_LAYERS`/`BRAND`/`PAGES`/`IMAGES`/`BRANCHES`/`SEARCH`) are wired.
- **Fix applied:** added `useHotkeys(Hotkey.SIDEBAR_INSERT.command, () => toggleLeftPanelTab(LeftPanelTabValue.INSERT), { preventDefault: true })` next to the other sidebar bindings. Pattern matches existing wirings exactly.

---

## CR-002 — UI focus-ring refactor leaves inconsistent ring widths across components

- **Area:** [packages/ui/src/globals.css](packages/ui/src/globals.css), [packages/ui/src/components/](packages/ui/src/components/) (badge, button, checkbox, dialog, input, navigation-menu, radio-group, scroll-area, select, sheet, sidebar, slider, switch, tabs, toggle, accordion, color-picker)
- **Type:** design debt / a11y
- **Impact:** user-facing (focus-visible appearance)
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** Global rule was added to `globals.css` (`button/[role=button]/a/input/select/textarea/summary:focus-visible` → `outline-hidden ring-2 ring-ring ring-offset-2`). At the same time many per-component `focus-visible:ring-[3px]` and `focus-visible:border-ring` classes were *removed* from some components (Accordion, Badge, NavigationMenu, ScrollArea, Select, Sheet) but *kept* on others (Switch, Toggle, RadioGroupItem, Checkbox, Input, Tabs, Slider). The result is that some focusable controls now show a `ring-2` focus ring (from global) while others compose `ring-2` + `ring-[3px]` (from class) producing a thicker ring. Visually inconsistent.
- **Suggested approach:** pick one source of truth. Either remove the remaining per-component `focus-visible:*` classes and rely entirely on the global rule, or keep per-component classes and remove the global rule. Audit Storybook/dev to confirm.

---

## CR-003 — ColorPicker `Input` lost inset focus ring; global focus rule will overflow tight UI

- **Area:** [color-picker/ColorPicker.tsx:13](packages/ui/src/components/color-picker/ColorPicker.tsx)
- **Type:** bug (regression)
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** medium
- **Summary:** Removed `outline-0 focus:ring-1 ring-inset ring-foreground-active` from the `tw\`...\`` input styling. The input is still an `<input>` element so the new global rule (`input:focus-visible { ring-2 ring-ring ring-offset-2 }`) applies an *offset* ring that protrudes outside the picker chrome. Inset ring was deliberate.
- **Suggested approach:** restore an inset ring locally, e.g. `focus-visible:ring-1 focus-visible:ring-inset focus-visible:ring-foreground-active focus-visible:ring-offset-0`, and override the offset from the global. Verify in the live picker.

---

## CR-004 — Search `useMemo` deps invalidate on every render; BFS uses `Array.shift()`

- **Area:** [search-tab/use-search.ts:128-195](apps/web/client/src/app/project/[id]/_components/left-panel/design-panel/search-tab/use-search.ts)
- **Type:** performance
- **Impact:** internal
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** `allFrames`, `selectedFrameIds`, `layerRoots`, `layerSizes` are recomputed each render (each `.filter`/`.map` returns a new array reference), so the result `useMemo` recomputes the entire BFS on every render even when `debounced`/`filter`/`scope` haven't changed. Additionally, the traversal uses `stack.shift()` which is O(n²) on large element trees (a queue should use a write-only index, or DFS via `pop()`).
- **Suggested approach:** stabilize deps with `useMemo`/`useCallback` or use a content key (e.g. concat of `frameId:rootDomId` plus a layer-mapping version counter). Switch traversal to `stack.pop()` for DFS, or use a dedicated queue. Worth measuring on a large frame.

---

## CR-005 — Reasoning content disappears as soon as streaming ends

- **Area:** [chat-messages/message-content/index.tsx:52-66](apps/web/client/src/app/project/[id]/_components/right-panel/chat-tab/chat-messages/message-content/index.tsx)
- **Type:** UX regression
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** medium
- **Summary:** Previously `Reasoning` was always rendered (with shimmer styles only while streaming). Now it returns `null` unless `isStream && isLastPart`. Once the assistant finishes, the user can no longer expand/inspect what the model was thinking — the reasoning content vanishes from the conversation. Search/audit/debug becomes harder.
- **Suggested approach:** confirm intent with PM/design. If the goal was just to stop the shimmer post-stream, keep rendering `Reasoning` but only apply the shimmer/animate classes while `isStream && isLastPart`. Avoid hiding the content entirely.

---

## CR-006 — Iframe live preview no longer sets `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`

- **Area:** [project-preview-surface.tsx:97-110](apps/web/client/src/app/projects/_components/select/project-preview-surface.tsx)
- **Type:** privacy / security
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** The redesigned project tile iframe dropped `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`. Each project tile now leaks the projects-page Referer to the embedded site on load. Minor but cheap to restore.
- **Suggested approach:** re-add `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"` (and consider `sandbox` to prevent third-party JS in the previewed site from running freely against an iframe context attached to onlook.com).

---

## CR-007 — `WRAP_IN_DIV` (cmd+alt+g) is identical to `GROUP` (cmd+g)

- **Area:** [hotkey.ts:43-44](apps/web/client/src/components/hotkey.ts), [canvas/hotkeys/index.tsx:185-191](apps/web/client/src/app/project/[id]/_components/canvas/hotkeys/index.tsx)
- **Type:** UX / inconsistency
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** `Hotkey.WRAP_IN_DIV` was added as `mod+alt+g` with the label "Wrap in Div", and `UNGROUP` was renamed to "Unwrap parent". Both `GROUP` and `WRAP_IN_DIV` are routed to the same `editorEngine.group.groupSelectedElements()`, so they behave identically despite the different label. If "Wrap in Div" is intended to behave differently (e.g. always wrap a single element in a fresh div regardless of selection count), the handler needs to diverge.
- **Suggested approach:** decide whether `WRAP_IN_DIV` is just a marketing label for `GROUP` or a separate operation, then either drop the duplicate hotkey or implement a distinct `wrapInDiv` action.

---

## CR-008 — Default chat model hardcoded to `OPENROUTER_MODELS.KIMI_K2_6` *(done)*

- **Area:** [chat-tab-content/index.tsx](apps/web/client/src/app/project/[id]/_components/right-panel/chat-tab/chat-tab-content/index.tsx)
- **Type:** maintainability
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** medium
- **Summary:** Default state was `OPENROUTER_MODELS.KIMI_K2_6` rather than the canonical option list head.
- **Resolution (2026-05-03):** Working tree now uses `useState<ChatModel>(CHAT_MODEL_OPTIONS[0].model)` and additionally hydrates from `userSettings?.chat.defaultModel` once settings load (gated by a `userChangedModel` ref so a session-level pick beats the saved default). Marking done.

---

## CR-009 — Model selector hides label under 260px container

- **Area:** [chat-input/model-selector.tsx:42](apps/web/client/src/app/project/[id]/_components/right-panel/chat-tab/chat-input/model-selector.tsx)
- **Type:** UX
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** `<span className="@[260px]:inline hidden ...">` only shows the model label when the container is ≥260px wide. On a narrow chat panel the user sees only a chevron — no indication of which model is active.
- **Suggested approach:** keep a short truncated form (e.g. icon + first letters) below the breakpoint, or render a tooltip on hover that always shows the current model.

---

## CR-010 — Mobile/desktop layout swap may flicker and drop unmounted state

- **Area:** [main.tsx:36-130](apps/web/client/src/app/project/[id]/_components/main.tsx)
- **Type:** UX / refactor
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** Renders `null` until `useEffect` measures `window.innerWidth`, then conditionally renders `<MobileLayout/>` vs the desktop tree. On viewport resize across the 768px breakpoint the entire editor (Canvas, ChatTab, modals) unmounts and remounts. Brief blank flash on first paint, plus loss of any local component state at the boundary.
- **Suggested approach:** prefer CSS-driven hide/show with both layouts in the DOM at all times, OR use `matchMedia` and an SSR-aware default to avoid the `null` first paint. Only swap the tree if there's strong reason (e.g. touch vs pointer event handling).

---

## CR-011 — Comments router writes user metadata as `authorName` without sanitation

- **Area:** [routers/comment/comment.ts:43-46](apps/web/client/src/server/api/routers/comment/comment.ts), [routers/comment/reply.ts:30-33](apps/web/client/src/server/api/routers/comment/reply.ts)
- **Type:** privacy / display safety
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** low/medium
- **Summary:** `authorName` now falls back to `ctx.user.user_metadata?.name ?? ctx.user.user_metadata?.full_name ?? ctx.user.email`. Supabase user_metadata is user-controllable (set during signup or via update profile) — an author can put arbitrary content (including emoji, RTL, or impersonation strings) into it and it will be displayed verbatim everywhere. Also reveals the user's real name on what was previously an email-only display, which is a small privacy shift.
- **Suggested approach:** decide whether you want to (a) display real names (then add length/character validation server-side, and consider a separate `display_name` field) or (b) keep email-only. If displaying name, render with explicit text node only (not innerHTML) — confirm the comments-tab/popover rendering escapes properly.

---

## CR-012 — Desktop release uses `npm install` in a Bun monorepo

- **Area:** [.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml](.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml), [apps/desktop/RELEASES.md](apps/desktop/RELEASES.md)
- **Type:** DX / build correctness
- **Impact:** infra
- **Risk:** medium
- **Summary:** CLAUDE.md states "Use Bun for all installs and scripts; do not use npm, yarn, or pnpm." The new workflow runs `npm install` in `apps/desktop/`. If the Electron app shares any workspace deps with the monorepo, the npm-resolved tree may differ from the Bun lockfile and ship a different version of a transitive dep than what local devs/CI test. Also there's no lockfile commit produced — `npm install` creates a `package-lock.json` that is not tracked, so installs are non-deterministic.
- **Suggested approach:** switch to `bun install --frozen-lockfile` (matching the rest of the monorepo) or commit a `package-lock.json` in `apps/desktop` and use `npm ci`. Either way, lock the install for reproducibility.

---

## CR-013 — `parseRepoUrl` regex matches any host containing the substring "github.com/"

- **Area:** [routers/github.ts:11-23](apps/web/client/src/server/api/routers/github.ts)
- **Type:** security (low blast radius)
- **Impact:** internal
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** Regex `github\.com\/([^/]+)\/([^/]+?)(?:\.git)?$` will accept `https://evilgithub.com/owner/repo` (subdomain attack: substring still matches). The mutation runs against the user's authenticated Octokit, so an attacker-controlled `repoUrl` could only cause API calls against `owner/repo` on the real GitHub anyway (Octokit ignores the host string), so the practical impact is limited — but the validation gives a false sense of safety.
- **Suggested approach:** parse with `new URL(repoUrl)` and assert `u.hostname === 'github.com' || u.hostname === 'www.github.com'`. Then take the first two path segments.

---

## CR-014 — `static-templates.tsx` `id: string` decouples from alias map keys

- **Area:** [static-templates.tsx:9](apps/web/client/src/app/projects/_components/templates/static-templates.tsx), [select/index.tsx:48-90](apps/web/client/src/app/projects/_components/select/index.tsx)
- **Type:** maintainability
- **Impact:** internal
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** `StaticTemplate.id` is typed as `string`. `STATIC_TEMPLATE_ALIASES` and the `templateNames` map in `select/index.tsx` use `Record<StaticTemplate['id'], …>` which collapses to `Record<string, …>` — adding a new TEMPLATES entry will not produce a TS error if its alias entry is missing, and `availableStaticTemplateIds` will silently drop it.
- **Suggested approach:** narrow the id with a literal-union type (`'portfolio' | 'saas' | …`) and reuse it across both files. Then missing aliases become compile errors.

# Review pass 2026-05-03

Scope: 18 modified files + 4 unpushed commits + a large set of new untracked files spanning Ollama support, transcription endpoint, local-folder import, settings overhaul (account/ai/appearance/editor/git/github/language/shortcuts tabs), framework adapters, and an MCP package.

## CR-015 — Transcribe route used `Onlook` brand strings *(auto-fixed)*

- **Area:** [api/transcribe/route.ts](apps/web/client/src/app/api/transcribe/route.ts)
- **Type:** bug (brand)
- **Impact:** internal (OpenRouter dashboard attribution)
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** Outbound headers were `HTTP-Referer: https://onlook.com` and `X-Title: Onlook`, in violation of the CLAUDE.md "Weblab" rule for user-facing strings.
- **Fix applied:** swapped to `https://weblab.build` and `Weblab`. No behavior change beyond the OpenRouter attribution string.

## CR-016 — `/api/models/local` is unauthenticated and unrate-limited

- **Area:** [api/models/local/route.ts](apps/web/client/src/app/api/models/local/route.ts)
- **Type:** security / hardening
- **Impact:** internal
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** No `getSupabaseUser` check, no rate limit. SSRF is correctly mitigated (loopback-only allowlist on `baseUrl`), but the inconsistency with `/api/chat` and `/api/transcribe` (both auth + rate-limited) is worth addressing.
- **Suggested approach:** Wrap with `getSupabaseUser` and reuse the in-memory limiter from `transcribe/helpers/rate-limit.ts` (or factor a shared limiter).

## CR-017 — Local-Ollama detection probes the *server's* localhost, not the user's

- **Area:** [api/models/local/route.ts](apps/web/client/src/app/api/models/local/route.ts), [chat-tab-content/index.tsx](apps/web/client/src/app/project/[id]/_components/right-panel/chat-tab/chat-tab-content/index.tsx), [ai-tab.tsx](apps/web/client/src/components/ui/settings-modal/ai-tab.tsx)
- **Type:** design / deployment-dependent bug
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** medium
- **Summary:** The "detect local Ollama" flow runs server-side (`fetch('http://localhost:11434/api/tags')` from a Next.js Route Handler). On Vercel/hosted deployments, `localhost` is the function container — *not* the user's machine — so the feature only works in self-hosted/dev. In hosted mode it always returns 0 models and silently misleads the AI tab UI ("No local models detected. Make sure Ollama is running.").
- **Suggested approach:** Either (a) move detection to client-side (browser → `http://localhost:11434/api/tags` directly; needs Ollama CORS config), or (b) gate the entire local-models UI behind a self-hosted flag so hosted users don't see a broken affordance.

## CR-018 — Race condition in local-models fetch on URL change

- **Area:** [chat-tab-content/index.tsx](apps/web/client/src/app/project/[id]/_components/right-panel/chat-tab/chat-tab-content/index.tsx), [ai-tab.tsx](apps/web/client/src/components/ui/settings-modal/ai-tab.tsx) (`detectLocalModels`)
- **Type:** bug
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** Both fire `fetch('/api/models/local?...')` from `useEffect` without an `AbortController`. Rapid edits to the Ollama URL (or unmount during in-flight) can let an older response resolve last and overwrite the newer model list. `response.ok` also isn't checked before `response.json()`, so a 4xx HTML body would throw and be silently swallowed by the `.catch(() => setLocalModels([]))`.
- **Suggested approach:** Wire an `AbortController` per fetch; abort on dep change and on unmount. Check `response.ok` and treat non-2xx as "unavailable" with a console warn.

## CR-019 — Ollama base URL double-`/api` if user includes path segment

- **Area:** [packages/ai/src/chat/providers.ts](packages/ai/src/chat/providers.ts) (`getOllamaProvider`), [api/models/local/route.ts](apps/web/client/src/app/api/models/local/route.ts)
- **Type:** bug
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** `${baseUrl.replace(/\/$/, '')}/api` always appends `/api`. If a user pastes `http://localhost:11434/api`, the SDK will be configured with `http://localhost:11434/api/api`. Mirror issue in the probe route.
- **Suggested approach:** Normalize once: strip a single trailing `/api` segment if present before appending. Extract a small util in `@onlook/models` and reuse in both places.

## CR-020 — `ChatModel` type widened; route forwards arbitrary `ollama/<anything>`

- **Area:** [packages/models/src/llm/index.ts](packages/models/src/llm/index.ts), [packages/ai/src/agents/root.ts](packages/ai/src/agents/root.ts), [api/chat/route.ts](apps/web/client/src/app/api/chat/route.ts)
- **Type:** hardening
- **Impact:** internal
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** `ChatModel = OPENROUTER_MODELS | OllamaModelId` (where `OllamaModelId = \`ollama/${string}\``) means any string of that shape is type-valid. The chat route forwards it to `initModel` without validation. Garbage like `ollama/../foo` only fails because the upstream Ollama HTTP API rejects unknown names — we shouldn't rely on that.
- **Suggested approach:** Validate the part after `ollama/` against a name regex (e.g. `^[a-z0-9._:-]+$`) before forwarding. Reject otherwise with a 400.

## CR-021 — `getOllamaProvider` casts via `as unknown as LanguageModel`

- **Area:** [packages/ai/src/chat/providers.ts](packages/ai/src/chat/providers.ts)
- **Type:** DX / type safety
- **Impact:** internal
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** Forced double-cast through `unknown` papers over a type mismatch between `ollama-ai-provider-v2` and the `ai` SDK's `LanguageModel`. If either SDK shifts, TS won't catch a regression.
- **Suggested approach:** Track the real incompatibility (likely v1 vs v2 of `LanguageModel`); pin matching versions and remove the cast.

## CR-022 — `useImportLocalProject` drops the import intent on unauthed entry

- **Area:** [hooks/use-import-local-project.ts](apps/web/client/src/hooks/use-import-local-project.ts)
- **Type:** UX
- **Impact:** user-facing
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** When the user clicks "Open local folder" while signed out, the auth modal opens and the return URL is saved — but the folder picker isn't reopened after sign-in. User has to remember to click the button again.
- **Suggested approach:** Set a "resume intent" localforage flag before opening auth. After successful auth, the `projects` page reads it and re-triggers the picker once.

## CR-023 — DB schema changes (`default_model`, `ollama_base_url`) require `bun db:push`

- **Area:** [packages/db/src/schema/user/settings.ts](packages/db/src/schema/user/settings.ts) and mappers/defaults
- **Type:** ops note
- **Impact:** infra
- **Risk:** medium (forgotten = runtime failure on first save)
- **Summary:** Two new nullable text columns added to `user_settings`. RLS-enabled. No migration file is committed (the project uses `db:push`, not generated SQL), so columns won't exist in any environment until someone runs it.
- **Suggested approach:** Run `bun db:push` against staging/prod (maintainer-only per CLAUDE.md). Confirm the existing `user_settings` RLS policies cover the new columns.

## CR-024 — `/api/transcribe` 90s `AbortController` flagged for Workflow *(discussion-only)*

- **Area:** [api/transcribe/route.ts](apps/web/client/src/app/api/transcribe/route.ts)
- **Type:** discussion
- **Impact:** infra
- **Risk:** low
- **Summary:** Vercel best-practice hook flagged the 90s timeout as "long-running serverless logic, consider Workflow." For a single request/response upstream call this isn't a Workflow fit — Workflow targets durable, pausable, multi-step flows. Vercel's 300s default function timeout already accommodates 90s.
- **Suggested approach:** No action. Logged here so the team has the trace if/when transcription becomes a multi-step or streaming flow.
